# Project Name: CC4.1: Orient and Engage (Professional Tools, Install Python)

## Welcome
Welcome to the CC4.1: Orient and Engage project! This project is designed to help you transition from using Python and PyShiny in the browser to working locally on your machine. By following these instructions carefully, you'll learn how to set up your development environment and utilize essential tools such as Python, VS Code, and Git.

## Overview
In this module, we'll focus on local development, which offers numerous benefits despite requiring some initial setup. While the tools themselves aren't the primary focus of this course, mastering them will greatly enhance your skills and prepare you for real-world scenarios.

## Plan Your Week
Expect to invest approximately 20 hours per week into this course, which includes both in-class time and independent study. To optimize your learning experience, consider working ahead during the weekends and staying on track with the provided schedule.

### Actions:
1. **Create a GitHub Project Repo**: Set up a new project repository on GitHub named "cintel-04-local" and add essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py`.
   
2. **Download Python**: Install the latest version of Python on your machine. Ensure to include Python in your system's PATH for easy access.

3. **Install Python, Add to Path, and Verify**: Follow platform-specific instructions to install Python and verify the installation by checking the version and pip installation.

4. **Get Help with Python Basics**: Utilize AI assistants to learn Python basics, such as variables, functions, data types, or list comprehensions. Share your conversation and screenshots for verification.
