# Project Name: CC4.1: Orient and Engage (Professional Tools, Install Python)

## Welcome
Welcome to CC4.1! This project helps you switch from using Python and PyShiny in the browser to local development. You'll learn to use essential tools like Python, VS Code, and Git.

## Overview
This module focuses on local development, which prepares you for real-world scenarios. Mastering these tools enhances your skills for data analytics work.

## Plan Your Week
Expect to invest around 20 hours per week. Use weekends to work ahead for optimal learning.

### Actions:
1. **Create a GitHub Project Repo**: Set up a new project repository on GitHub named "cintel-04-local" and add essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py`.
   
2. **Download Python**: Install the latest version of Python on your machine and include it in your system's PATH.

3. **Install Python, Add to Path, and Verify**: Follow platform-specific instructions to install Python. Verify the installation by checking the version and pip installation.

4. **Get Help with Python Basics**: Use AI assistants to learn Python basics such as variables, functions, data types, or list comprehensions. Share your conversation and screenshots for verification.
